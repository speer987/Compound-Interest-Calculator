# Compound Interest Calculator

###### By Saarah Peer

Welcome to my Compound Interest Calculator Web Application. Here are some features encompassed on this webpage:

- Calculates compound interest when given principal, interest rate (as a percent), number of times compounded (per year), and total number of years.
- Has a nice purplish gradient background.
- An imported Google Font known as DM Sans.
- A three by four grid layout used to position various elements on-screen.
- A flex layout that allows the form to be formatted neatly within the center grid cell.
- Responsiveness (which was built into the template).
- A h1 element for the title that also has a text-shadow.
- Four images (including one with a chubby guinea pig) that were each transformed by slightly rotating them and also have a transition that makes the image shrink when you hover over them.
- A variety of input elements such as the principal textbox, all other fields being numeric boxes, and two buttons that can calculate and reset entries.
- Various elements that have margin, padding, and borders.
- header and footer html tags that are integrated with css.
- A footer with the link to my source code on CodeSandbox.
- Contrasting colors between words and background and a simple layout.
- Other features such as commas between three digits in the output for compound interest (ie. 2,000,000).
- Checks if the inputs are positive before outputting the compound interest.

Note: I also had to learn about grid, flex, and some other elements on websites such as css-tricks, W3Schools, MDN Documentation, and StackOverflow.
